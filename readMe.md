This project is to work on my OOP skills in Python. Its almost an exact replication of my project in java but with just python. Here, I only implemented the model of the game, with no front end view like I had for the java project. The game can be played on the command line.


TODO

- Implement __eq__ command for the comparision operator equivalent in java
- Reimplement Player Logic slightly so the player class does not create a player object inside its own class blueprint
- Implement an Move interface in python (either a soft interface or a hard interface as Python interfaces are different from java)

ModelTester.py is the entry point of the application so far.
